``GuidedLDA`` OR ``SeededLDA`` implements latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) using collapsed Gibbs sampling. ``GuidedLDA`` can be guided by setting some seed words per topic. Which will make the topics converge in that direction.

You can read more about guidedlda in `the documentation <https://guidedlda.readthedocs.io>`_.

I published an article about it on `freecodecamp Medium blog <https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-we-changed-unsupervised-lda-to-semi-supervised-guidedlda-e36a95f3a164>`_.

Installation
------------

::

    pip install guidedlda

If pip install does not work, then try the next step:

::

    https://github.com/vi3k6i5/GuidedLDA
    cd GuidedLDA
    sh build_dist.sh
    python setup.py sdist
    pip install -e .

If the above step also does not work, please raise an `issue <https://github.com/vi3k6i5/guidedlda/issues>`_ with details of your workstation's OS version, Python version, architecture etc. and I will try my best to fix it ASAP.

Getting started
---------------

``guidedlda.GuidedLDA`` implements latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). The interface follows
conventions found in scikit-learn_.

`Example Code <https://github.com/vi3k6i5/GuidedLDA/blob/master/examples/example_seeded_lda.py>`_.


The following demonstrates how to inspect a model of a subset of the NYT
news dataset. The input below, ``X``, is a document-term matrix (sparse matrices
are accepted).

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import guidedlda
    
    >>> X = guidedlda.datasets.load_data(guidedlda.datasets.NYT)
    >>> vocab = guidedlda.datasets.load_vocab(guidedlda.datasets.NYT)
    >>> word2id = dict((v, idx) for idx, v in enumerate(vocab))
    
    >>> X.shape
    (8447, 3012)
    
    >>> X.sum()
    1221626
    >>> # Normal LDA without seeding
    >>> model = guidedlda.GuidedLDA(n_topics=5, n_iter=100, random_state=7, refresh=20)
    >>> model.fit(X)

The document-topic distributions should be retrived as: ``doc_topic = model.transform(X)``.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> doc_topic = model.transform(X)
    >>> for i in range(9):
    >>>     print("top topic: {} Document: {}".format(doc_topic[i].argmax(), 
                                                      ', '.join(np.array(vocab)[list(reversed(X[i,:].argsort()))[0:5]])))
    top topic: 4 Document: plant, increase, food, increasingly, animal
    top topic: 3 Document: explain, life, country, citizen, nation
    top topic: 2 Document: thing, solve, problem, machine, carry
    top topic: 2 Document: company, authority, opera, artistic, director
    top topic: 3 Document: partner, lawyer, attorney, client, indict
    top topic: 2 Document: roll, place, soon, treat, rating
    top topic: 3 Document: city, drug, program, commission, report
    top topic: 1 Document: company, comic, series, case, executive
    top topic: 3 Document: son, scene, charge, episode, attack

Optionally, reduce the model by purging additional matrices:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> # Next step will lighten the model object
    >>> # This step will delete some matrices inside the model.
    >>> # you will be able to use model.transform(X) the same way as earlier.
    >>> # you wont be able to use model.fit_transform(X_new)
    >>> model.purge_extra_matrices()

Save the model for production or for running later:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from six.moves import cPickle as pickle
    >>> with open('guidedlda_model.pickle', 'wb') as file_handle:
    >>>     pickle.dump(model, file_handle)
    >>> # load the model for prediction
    >>> with open('guidedlda_model.pickle', 'rb') as file_handle:
    >>>     model = pickle.load(file_handle)
    >>> doc_topic = model.transform(X)


Requirements
------------

Python 2.7 or Python 3.3+ is required. The following packages are required

- numpy_
- pbr_

Caveat
------

``guidedlda`` aims for Guiding LDA. More often then not the topics we get from a LDA model are not to our satisfaction. GuidedLDA can give the topics a nudge in the direction we want it to converge. We have production trained it for half a million documents (We have a big machine). We have run predictions on millions and manually checked topics for thousands (we are satisfied with the results).

If you are working with a very large corpus you may wish to use more sophisticated topic models such as those implemented in hca_ and MALLET_.  hca_ is written entirely in C and MALLET_ is written in Java. Unlike ``guidedlda``, hca_ can use more than one processor at a time. Both MALLET_ and hca_ implement topic models known to be more robust than standard latent Dirichlet allocation.

Notes
-----

Latent Dirichlet allocation is described in `Blei et al. (2003)`_ and `Pritchard
et al. (2000)`_. Inference using collapsed Gibbs sampling is described in
`Griffiths and Steyvers (2004)`_. And Guided LDA is described in `Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi, Hal Daume III and Raghavendra Udupa (2012)`_
